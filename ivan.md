## Heroes
### Concept Art
As responsible for the creation of the two new units, i've created concpet arts of one of the 2 heroes, the mage. It a drawing made by hand and then passe to the computer which shows all the elements that the hero will have which will then be transformed into pixel art.

### Pixel Art
From the previous concept art and another done by my collegue, i've created from sratch a new spritesheet with all the necessary movement and position of each hero for our game. This spritesheet consists of movement, attack and death animations each of them adapted to the style of Warcraft II pixel art.

## Artist
As the artist of Lazy Fox i've been given my point of view in any matter regarding to art. For example: change sprite form units we already haved, the asthetics points of view of all elements... . I've also been the one who has recommended which tools to use regarding art work and the one to set and organization to all the work coming from this area.

### General Art
A part from the specific work of creating a new unit, i've also been working on any task regarding the already excrated art and off game art.

- New sprites for building to show during the building process.

- Team logo.

- Animated logo intro.

- Forest tileset.

### QA
As a memeber of the team i´ve also have to make sure everything works and therefore qa needs to be done. Whenever i found a buf i made and issue and in some cases fix it in the code.
