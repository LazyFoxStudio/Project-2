## Minimap

The minimap portion of the GUI was made by me.

It has alerts with sound and also images can be put in, the usage of this minimap is really simple with only 1 line of code for each object for it to work.

## Save and Load

This feature is the save and load functionallity so that players can save and load and also bring their stored saves with them, it saves everything that is going on in the match into a little xml file that is readable and organized so that errors and bugs can be easily detected.

## Video player

Video playing functionallity 

I polished some parts to make it fit better into our game, things like centering the video, making the rest of the screen go black...

Made with the help of this research page: **[Page for the research on this specific topic](https://github.com/JoanValiente/Video-Player-Research)**

## QA

As the QA of the team I did some testing to make sure everything worked and tried to make sure everything was on its place in the releases, which were done effectively and easy due to making sure the assets folder was organized and easy to prepare.
